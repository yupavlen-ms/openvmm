### failed to open `/dev/kvm/`

**Error:**

```
fatal error: failed to launch vm worker

Caused by:
    0: failed to launch worker
    1: failed to create the prototype partition
    2: kvm error
    3: failed to open /dev/kvm
    4: Permission denied (os error 13)
```

**Solution:**

When launching from a Linux/WSL host, your user account will need permission to
interact with `/dev/kvm`.

For example, you could add yourself to the group that owns that file:

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G <group> <username>
```

For this change to take effect, you may need to restart. If using WSL2, you can
simply restart WSL2 (run `wsl --shutdown` from Powershell and reopen the WSL
window).

Alternatively, for a quick-and-dirty solution that will only persist for the
duration of the current user session:

```bash
sudo chown <username> /dev/kvm
```
