## \[Hyper-V] Vtl2/Vtl0 failed to start

VTL2/VTL0 fails to boot is when either VTL2 or VTL0 has crashed. When the crash happens, they will emit an event to the Hyper-V worker channel.

First, check `Hyper-V worker  events` at `Applications and Services Logs -> Microsoft -> Windows -> Hyper-V-Worker-Admin`

Alternatively, some queries you can use to get Hyper-V-Worker logs:
- Display the `{n}` most recent events -  `wevtutil qe Microsoft-Windows-Hyper-V-Worker-Admin /c:{n} /rd:true /f:text`
- Export events to file - `wevtutil epl Microsoft-Windows-Hyper-V-Worker-Admin C:\vtl2_0_crash.evtx`
