# Contributing

This chapter discusses various things developers should be aware of prior to
submitting changes to the OpenVMM project.

This includes both code-level [coding conventions](./contrib/code.md), as well
as instructions on properly [submitting changes](./contrib/pr.md) to the OpenVMM
GitHub repo, and expectations around [code reviews](./contrib/code_review.md).
