//! Traits and types for save/restore support.
//!
//! To implement save/restore for your device or state unit, you must do these
//! things:
//!
//! 1. You define a saved state type. This type needs to be stable across
//!    releases, so you should not share types with your implementation even if
//!    they are currently identical. By decoupling your runtime types and your
//!    saved state types, you are much less likely to accidentally break saved
//!    state compatibility.
//!
//! 2. `derive` some traits on your type. Specifically, you must derive
//!    [`Protobuf`] so that your type can be encoded into protobuf format, and
//!    any fields in your type must also implement [`Protobuf`].
//!
//!    So that your saved state type can show up in generated `.proto` files,
//!    you must also set an attribute `#[mesh(package = "my.package.name")]`.
//!    This specifies the protobuf package, as well as the file name of your
//!    protobuf file. For the root object of your device's saved state, this
//!    package name becomes part of the serialized state, so you cannot change
//!    it later.
//!
//!    Finally, in the root object of your saved state, you must additionally
//!    derive [`SavedStateRoot`]. This provides some additional metadata so that
//!    we can find your saved state type and generate a `.proto` file from it
//!    for analysis. You only need to put this on the root types or types that
//!    will be converted to [`SavedStateBlob`]; the infrastructure will find any
//!    dependent types. But it doesn't hurt to put it on other types, too.
//!
//! 3. Typically, you implement the [`SaveRestore`] trait. This trait allows you
//!    to specify your associated saved state type and to implement `save` and
//!    `restore` methods that act on this type.
//!
//!    For some device types (such as vmbus devices), you may need to use a
//!    device-specific trait that provides additional parameters. But the
//!    pattern should be the same.

// UNSAFETY: Needed to use linkme for deriving SavedStateRoot.

/// Derives [`SavedStateRoot`] for a type.
///
/// This ensures that a saved state blob's metadata can be found, so that it can
/// be used to generate .proto files and perform offline analysis of saved state
/// compatibility.
///
/// To use this, you must also derive [`Protobuf`] and set a protobuf package
/// for your type. The package name should be defined to group related types
/// together; typically the same package should be used for all types defined in
/// a module.
///
/// For example:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use vmcore::save_restore::{SavedStateRoot, SavedStateBlob};
/// # use mesh::payload::Protobuf;
/// #[derive(Protobuf, SavedStateRoot)]
/// #[mesh(package = "test.my_device")]
/// struct MySavedState {
///     #[mesh(1)]
///     active: bool,
/// }
///
/// // This will now compile.
/// let _blob = SavedStateBlob::new(MySavedState { active: true });
/// ```
