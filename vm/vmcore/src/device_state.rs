    /// Starts a device, allowing it to interact with the guest asynchronously.

    /// For example, a device might process work queues that reside in guest
    /// memory on a separate thread.

    /// Callers must ensure that the device is in a stopped state before calling
    /// this method.
    ///
    /// This is a synchronous method instead of an asynchronous one because it
    /// is a notification only--callers do not need to wait for the device to
    /// finish starting to consider the VM started. Devices should kick off any
    /// tasks that need to run any return, without waiting.
    ///
    // FUTURE: make this asynchronous if any device has a good reason to need
    // it. This may also require changing state units to wait for device start
    // to finish, which may require a bunch of other changes.
