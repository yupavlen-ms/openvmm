    /// memory on a separate thread.

    /// this method.
    ///
    /// This is a synchronous method instead of an asynchronous one because it
    /// is a notification only--callers do not need to wait for the device to
    /// finish starting to consider the VM started. Devices should kick off any
    /// tasks that need to run any return, without waiting.

    // it. This may also require changing state units to wait for device start
    // to finish, which may require a bunch of other changes.
