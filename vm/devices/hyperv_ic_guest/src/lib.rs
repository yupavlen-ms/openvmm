//! Implementation of Hyper-V guest ICs (Integration Components).
//!
//! These are simple devices used to receive simple requests from the host or
//! otherwise provide some degree of integration between the guest and host.
//!
//! Examples (not all are necessarily implemented yet):
//!
//! * shutdown IC for initiating a guest shutdown
//! * timesync IC for synchronizing time
//! * heartbeat IC for reporting guest health
//! * KVP IC for exchanging arbitrary key/value data between the host and guest
