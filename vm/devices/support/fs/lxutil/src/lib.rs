///
/// Unix behavior is emulated on Windows, specifically targeting the behavior of Linux. The
/// semantics of some calls may differ slightly. In particular:
///
/// - Linux specific attributes (such as a file's mode and owner, and special file types like fifos
///   and device files) are only supported if metadata is enabled in the `LxVolumeOptions`, and
///   the underlying file system supports the required functionality (extended attributes and
///   reparse points). If this is not enabled, emulation of certain behavior like `chmod` is
///   limited.
/// - For files that don't have Linux metadata, `LxVolumeOptions` can be used to influence how
///   values for Linux attributes are created.
/// - The owner of a newly created file is specified in the `LxCreateOptions` passed to the
///   relevant create call.
/// - Linux permissions are not enforced, even if metadata is enabled.
///
/// # Unix
///
/// All calls pass through directly to their libc equivalent. Attributes like mode are always
/// enabled if the file system supports them. `LxVolumeOptions` is entirely ignored, as are the
/// `uid` and `gid` fields of `LxCreateOptions`.
