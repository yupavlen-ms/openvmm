//! Generally we hold the position that inspect paths are completely unstable,
//! may change at any time, and can not be depended on by anything. However, we
//! at Microsoft have implemented stable, versioned, supported, internal
//! diagnostic tools that depend on inspect paths under the hood. This would be
//! fine so long as we are guaranteed that our diagnostic tooling and OpenHCL
//! builds are always in sync, and indeed they are most of the time. However
//! there are cases where they may diverge temporarily, such as during servicing.
//! We still want to be able to provide as much information as possible during
//! these time periods, but in order for that to be possible we need some kind
//! of stable-ish interface to talk to OpenHCL with.
//!
//! This module provides that interface by creating known, controlled inspect
//! paths that are unlikely to change accidentally. The implementation details
//! of these paths are free to change in order to preserve their interface, and
//! all diagnostics commands should have extensive tests to ensure compatibility
//! with a matching build of OpenHCL.
//!
//! This approach is not particularly scalable, especially if other parties want
//! to add their own stabilized diagnostics and versioning schemes. If such a
//! need arises we should consider a more general and extensible solution.
//!
//! At the time of writing, our support policy is that these interfaces will be
//! preserved for at least 2 internal releases. This means that diagnostic
//! commands may fail in any way they see fit if the version of OpenHCL in the
//! VM is more than 2 releases old.
//!
//! In the future we may choose a different interface for these commands,
//! and this code may be deleted, however such a change will still follow the
//! above support policy.
